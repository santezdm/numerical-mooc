# model parameters:
g = 9.8      # gravity in m s^{-2}
v_t = 4.9   # trim velocity in m s^{-1}   
C_D = 1.  # drag coefficient --- or D/L if C_L=1
C_L = 5.    # for convenience, use C_L = 1

### set initial conditions ###
x0 = 0.0     # horizotal position is arbitrary
y0 = 1.7     # initial altitude --> height of person throwing airplane (m)

### what we want to find
# best combination of launch velocity and laucnh angle to give greatest
# distance. To do so, we'll create two arrays, one of launch angles from 0-90
# degrees, the other, velocities in the range of normal human throwing
# velocities. From there, we'll calculate the trajectory using the phugoid
# model for every combination of velocities and angles to determine the best
# combination. What we'll need: two nested for loops, one for the angles, the
# other for velocities, and a "keeper" array to carry the best combination
# across iterations.
